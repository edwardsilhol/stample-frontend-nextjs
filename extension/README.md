# Extension Stample

## Description

This is the Chrome extension for Stample.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- yarn
- Chrome

## Installation

### Development

We first run the extension using yarn dev, which will output an extension, that can then be imported inside chrome as an unpacked extension.

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn dev`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
4. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner
5. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the `dist` folder that was generated by `yarn dev`
6. The extension should now be loaded and you should be able to see it in the extensions list
7. Activate the extension like any other extension

You can now make changes to the extension and they will be automatically reloaded in Chrome.

### Production

TODO

## Content

### Manifest

The manifest file determines the name, version, description, icons, permissions, and other properties of the extension. It also declares which scripts and assets run on which pages.
You can change it in `manifest.ts`

### Content Script

Content scripts are javascript pages that are injected inside web pages. We use them to inject Stample content inside Google.com search page.
You can change it in `src/pages/content/`

### Background Script

Background scripts are javascript pages that run in the background of the extension. We use them to handle the communication between the content script and the popup. We mainly use it to access the google chrome storage.
You can change it in `src/pages/background/`

### Popup

The popup is the page that is displayed when you click on the extension icon. We use it to display the Stample popup.
You can change it in `src/pages/popup/`
