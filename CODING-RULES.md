# Coding Guidelines

ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´

##You must master this document before you write any code for any Goodwave project.

&nbsp;

**If you need help translating this document, don't be afraid and ask us right away.**

&nbsp;

At Goodwave, we take code quality very seriously. **Think before you write ! Write code that is easy to comprehend for someone else**. Always ask yourself : "Would I immediately understand how this works in 3 years?". Write code that someone less intelligent and less talented and less expert than you can still understand.

&nbsp;

###!!!! USE PROPER ENGLISH !!!!

&nbsp;

Adequate vocabulary and good grammar aren't just sexy, they also make code readable. **Name things in a way that will make a native english reader understand right away. If you have doubts, ask us**. Be careful, word order is different in English and in French. Double, triple check. Don't trust your intuition if you're not a native English speaker : you won't know if you're making a mistake, so **ASK ! No one will blame you for asking, but you will be blamed for not asking**.

&nbsp;

###<ins>GREAT PROGRAMMING DEPENDS ON NAMING THINGS EXACTLY FOR WHAT THEY ARE</ins>

&nbsp;

**Great programmers are extremely rigorous, and programmers should never be anything but great**. Poorly written code can destroy a project. If you don't want to be rigorous, do yourself and the world a favor and choose a different career.

# Strategy

&nbsp;

**If you're ever confused about what you should do about a technical decision, let us know RIGHT AWAY**.

**If you notice that writing a feature will take more time than we expected, let us know RIGHT AWAY.** There may be an alternative option, or we might choose to postpone writing the feature or even remove it. This is really important, <ins>don't waste time working on something we might decide to eliminate</ins>.

# Principles

&nbsp;

1. **Work with a fast computer and a big screen**. If you don't have those, talk to us, we'll fix it. Humans cost more than machines ;)

&nbsp;

2. If you're unsure about what to do at any moment **ask RIGHT AWAY**, no one will blame you for asking, but you will be blamed for not asking.

&nbsp;

3. **Always have ESLint and Prettier enabled in your IDE** and have them run automatically on `save. You won't be able to commit anyway if these don't pass. Also, use a good IDE with inference abilities (Intellij is amazing)

&nbsp;

4. **Check how the code is already written** in the project you work on. Identify the style and use it. If you see poorly written code, notify us right away.

&nbsp;

5. **Your code should read like almost like spoken english**. `makeSureCodeIsCleanBeforePushing` is a better method name than `qualityChecker`. Functional programming means code should be written like sentences which together make a **self documenting recipe**. Be explicit. Write <ins>precisely</ins> what your method does. Same with variables. There is a difference between `remove` and `delete`, for example. **Ask if you're not sure**.

&nbsp;

6. **Abstractions are only good if they make the code more readable**. If an abstraction makes the code much more efficient but less readable, check with us first and then write documentation to explain clearly how it works.

&nbsp;

7. **If you take a shortcut** because you need to deliver something fast (we know it happens), leave a TODO and **return to it as soon as you can**, before making a PR. Check the TODO rules below.

&nbsp;

8. **Don't leave duplicated code in a PR**, unless there's a good reason to leave it (you've been told we are in a rush and we'll improve later). If you leave duplicated code, leave a TODO explaining why.

&nbsp;

9. **Don't leave logs in the code when you make PR**, unless there's a good reason to leave them.

&nbsp;

10. <ins>**Bad code ends up costing hundreds of times what it cost to write**</ins>. Bad code makes projects fail. Don't do this to us, please. If something is too hard for you don't be afraid to say it. We'll do it for you and help you get better.

&nbsp;

11. If you think this document can be improved, let us know :)

# External libraries

&nbsp;

If you add an external library to your project, **make sure the library is widely used and maintained**. Check that there are recent commits and that a lot of people are using it. **ALWAYS confirm your choice with us** before writing code.

&nbsp;

---

# TODOs and comments

&nbsp;

**Don't leave TODOs in your code when you make a PR**. <ins>If you have to for some reason, get the OK from us first</ins>.

When leaving a TODO (even on your own branch while work is in progress), use the following syntax :

&nbsp;

- If not urgent: // **TODO**: What needs to be done and why

&nbsp;

- If urgent: // **TODO URGENT**: ...

&nbsp;

- If an optimization can be done: // **TODO OPTIMIZE**: ...

&nbsp;

Note that your IDE can be configured to highlight comments in a specific color based on a word. This is very helpful.

&nbsp;

# Naming

&nbsp;

- If you're changing the modelization of a project, **ALWAYS discuss the names you want to use for classes with us** before writing code.

&nbsp;

- **All names must make grammatical sense**. Some variables describe an item : `stringPrinter`. Others are a function and should read like a sentence `printString()`. So a `stringPrinter` can use `printString()`.

&nbsp;

- Names should **not require prior knowledge of a project**, but be generic, simple, and immediately understandable by an outsider.

&nbsp;

- **ALWAYS** use full nouns/verbs for naming, even parameters : `val -> value`, `el-> element`. When you speak you don't use `val` so don't write it.

&nbsp;

- **If you make a custom version of a component provided by a library, use the same name**, as if you were overriding a method. As an example, if you're making a custom Image component based on Ant Design's component, call it Image and use : `import { Image as AntImage } from 'antd'`. Also write a comment in the file to explain why you had to override the component.

&nbsp;

# Files

&nbsp;

- **Files must always stay short**. 200 lines is starting to get long. If a file starts growing, split it.

&nbsp;

- File naming should be consistent and easy to understand.

&nbsp;

- Research and follow best practices (Classes are Capitalized, etc...)

&nbsp;

- Respect the file structure we implemented. When in doubt, ask us.

&nbsp;

---

# Git

&nbsp;

- Branch names: should follow the convention: developerName/featureName

&nbsp;

- Rebasing is better than merging

&nbsp;

- Be explicit and thorough in your commit messages.
